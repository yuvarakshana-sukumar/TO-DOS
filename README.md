# TO-DOS
To-dos contain all of the tasks that you need to complete on a given day. Itâ€™s a great device for managing time that enables you to lay out everything that you need to accomplish and plan and prioritize your day from there. You can also make to-dos for major tasks like a work assignment or an overall goal. Therefore, the overall purpose of creating a to-do is to remember tasks and create a plan of action to accomplish them.
For the most part, to-dos are used to follow daily tasks, but you can also use them for larger projects like planning a party. Longer-term to-dos allow you to break major tasks into smaller chunks that are easier to accomplish and allow you to visualize every step you need to take to attain your goal. To-dos are incredibly versatile as they serve the general purpose of laying out tasks that you need to accomplish.
